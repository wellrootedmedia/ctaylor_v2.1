Photocrati Theme Admin

The file dynamic-style.php is a dynamically generated style sheet that is built using the theme options in the Wordpress admin. We highly suggest that you do not edit this file. 

If you would like to customize the style of this theme manually please log into the admin, click theme options and select NO from the 'Dynamic Styling Enabled?' drop down box. You can then use style.css in the theme directory to style your website.
